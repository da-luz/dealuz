# dealuz

dealuz is a short package containing an implementation for Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA).
Its development started in early 2024, but i kinda struggle with schedules

Although it is not a proper release, i am making this code public and i have plans to create
a proper documentation and uploading it to pip
